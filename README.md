# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

For this challenge, we've been tasked to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. For this analysis, we will determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews. The datasource for this assignment came from amazon reviews.

## Summary 

When looking at the percentage of 5 star reviews, the vine(or paid) reviews showed a percentage of 57%. Of the non-vine(not paid) 56% of the reviews were 5 stars. This shows that although the paid results were "more likely" to be 5 stars, the non paid results were as well! Therefore it can not be said that the vine reviews show a positivity bias since they are so close to the non paid reviews. Overall, reviews of musical instruments on amazon have above 50% five star reviews, paid and unpaid.
To further analyze our data, we could do some statistcal analysis such as looking at the standard deviation, mean and median to see if our dataset is "normal"
